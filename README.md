## Files

1. `dataset.py`: Contains the `Dataset` class, which loads images and labels from a directory.
2. `resnet.py`: Contains the implementation of the `ResNet18` model and its components.
3. `train.py`: Contains the `Train` class, which handles the preparation of the data and training the model.
4. `main.py`: The main script that uses the above classes to train the model.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following libraries:

- PyTorch
- torchvision
- pandas
- PIL
- matplotlib

Please ensure these are installed before running the scripts.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Intel Image Classification dataset, which contains 6 categories: 'buildings', 'forest', 'glacier', 'mountain', 'sea', and 'street'. The dataset is expected to be in a specific directory structure as specified in the `Dataset` class in `dataset.py`.

## Model

The model used is a ResNet18 model implemented in the `ResNet18` class in `resnet.py`.

## Training

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and the Cross Entropy Loss function. Training is performed for a specified number of epochs (10 by default).
