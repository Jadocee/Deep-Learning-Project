## Train

File: train.py

Author: Thomas Bandy

This file contains the implementation of the Train class, which handles training setup and data handling.

The Train class provides methods for splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets,
loading the data into DataLoader objects, printing information about the dataset and DataLoader,
and displaying a diagram of sample images from the training data.

### Usage

```python
from torchvision import transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from dataset import Dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create an instance of the Train class
train = Train()

# Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets
train.training_split()

# Load the training, validation, and test data into DataLoader objects
train_loader, valid_loader, test_loader = train.load_data()

# Print information about the dataset and DataLoader
train.print_checks()

# Display a diagram of sample images from the training data
train.diagram()
```
## Dataset

File: dataset.py

Author: Thomas Bandy

This file contains the implementation of the Dataset class for loading images and labels from a directory.

All docstrings were generated by ChatGPT.

### Usage

```python

import os
import glob
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
from PIL import Image

# Create an instance of the Dataset class
dataset = Dataset(data_dir, transform)

# Get the number of samples in the dataset
num_samples = len(dataset)

# Retrieve the image and label at a given index
image, label = dataset[idx]
```
## ResNet18

File: resnet.py

Author: Thomas Bandy

This file contains the implementation of the ResNet18 model and the Residual Block module in PyTorch.
The ResNet18 model is a 4-layer variant with 18 convolutional layers.

### Usage

```python

import torch
from torch import nn
from torchvision import transforms

# Create an instance of the ResNet18 model
model = ResNet18(in_channels, resblock, outputs)

# Perform the forward pass of the model
output = model(input)
```

## Residual Block

File: resnet.py

Author: Thomas Bandy

This file contains the implementation of the ResNet18 model and the Residual Block module in PyTorch.
The Residual Block module is a building block used in the ResNet18 model,
consisting of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and skip connections.
